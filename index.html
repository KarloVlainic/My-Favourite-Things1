    <h2 class="burlywood">Hawaii, Honolulu
    </h2>
    <hr />
<p>Honolulu is a beautiful city in Hawaii. The weather is really nice, people always helping eachother, and the water is so good, its really blue, really clear and never too cold. One of, if not the best vacation spot I have ever been to. </p>

<h2>Soccer</h2>
<hr />
    
<p>
    Soccer is my favourite sport, I have been playing it for a decent ammount of years and dont plan to stop anytime soon. My dad was the person that got me into Soccer, he played it a lot and was a really good goalkeeper. I like to play in the midfield area or defense, but if I get a chance to play attack I will not pass on the opportunity. Soccer positions are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Goalkeeper</li>
   <li>Defender</li>
   <li>Midfielder</li>
   <li>Attacker</li>
   My favourite player Luka Modric:

<h2>Cars</h2>
<hr />

<p>
    Cars, I absolutely love cars, especially older model cars. My favourite car brand is BMW, I love their car designs and they are decently fast cars. Specifically I like the BMW E46 M3, older type of car and a really good looking car.
